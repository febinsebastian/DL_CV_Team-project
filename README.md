__Building a demonstrator of Deep Learning Applications in Computer Vision__
# Description
This application is a single user interface for 3 real time deeplearning applications such as:
* Deep Facial Emotion Recognition
  * Emotion recognition is being actively explored in Computer Vision research. With the recent rise and popularization of Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, the potential to build intelligent systems that accurately recognize emotions became a closer reality. Emotion recognition has attracted major attention in numerous fields because of its relevant applications in the contemporary world: sociable robotics, medical treatment, driverfatigue surveillance, and human-computer interaction systems are some examples.
* YOLO Object Detection
  * YOLO(You Only Look Once) is a state of the art, real time object detection system. It is extremely faster and accurate. YOLO model is has several advantages over classifier- based systems. It applies single neural network to the full image.
* Neural Style Transfer
  * Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image. This is implemented by optimizing the output image to match the content statistics of the content image and the style statistics of the style reference image. These statistics are extracted from the images using a convolutional network.
