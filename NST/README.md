# Introduction
Neural style transfer is the process of:
* Taking the style of one image
* And then applying it to the content of another image.

In the above example the first picture is the content image(the image we want to transfer a style to) and the second image is the style image(the image we want to transfer the style from) and the third is the generated or the result image.
