# Deep Facial Expression Recognition
Facial expression recognition is an important part of human emotion recognition, which is widely used in human-computer interaction, pattern recognition, image understanding, machine vision and other fields. There are more than 10 thousand kinds of expressions, and different people have different ways to express their emotions. In this application we tried to recognise seven basic emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutral.
